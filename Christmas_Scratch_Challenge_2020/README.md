Christmas Scratch Coding Challenge 2020
=======================================

The Christmas Scratch Coding Challenge for 2020 is to use Scratch to create an animation, up to 45 secs long, for the festive season. This could be on a theme of Christmas, winter, eating too much, or anything else that happens at this time of year.

The details of the competition are in a powerpoint file called

There are two starter Scratch projects you can use, if you want, to give you ideas. These projects have backgrounds, and several ready made sprites for the themes. Here are the links for these Scratch projects:

### Christmas tree starter:

### Winter scene starter:

(The links are also included in the powerpoint file).

If you want to use these projects, then open them while you are logged on with your Scratch user, and **Remix** them, otherwise you will not be able to edit and save your own version.

Make sure your project is ready for judging at 11.15am on Saturday 14th December.

## Good Luck!
