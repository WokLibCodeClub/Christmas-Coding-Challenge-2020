Christmas Coding Challenge 2019
===============================

The Christmas Coding Challenge for 2019 is to use Scratch to create an animation, up to 45 secs long, for the festive season. This could be on a theme of Christmas, winter, eating too much, or anything else that happens at this time of year.

The details of the competition are in a powerpoint file called

There are two starter Scratch projects we have made on a couple of themes, which you can use if you want, to give you ideas. These projects have backgrounds, and several ready made sprites for the themes. Here are the links for these Scratch projects:

### Christmas tree starter:
